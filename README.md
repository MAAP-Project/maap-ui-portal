# MAAP Portal

The joint ESA-NASA Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform (MAAP) focuses on developing a collaborative data system enabling collocated data, processing, and analysis tools for NASA and ESA datasets. To facilitate discovery, user engagement, and support for the platform, we maintain a portal where users can learn about the platform by way of news articles and user guides. The portal also provides centralized access to MAAP's tools and services.
